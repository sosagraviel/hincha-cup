# UI Testing Orchestration

Coordinates test generation across four testing levels for UI tasks. Detects the project's existing testing infrastructure, loads framework-specific specializations, suggests setup when tools are missing, and delegates test generation to specialised mastery skills.

This skill is **stack-agnostic**. Core orchestration logic (test level selection, tool detection algorithm, report format) is framework-independent. Framework-specific knowledge (tool variants, install commands, starter configs) lives in `references/*-specialization.md` files that are loaded dynamically based on project detection.

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Parse Arguments

Extract from the invocation:

- `--ticket KEY` — ticket identifier (e.g. `DOP-194`). When provided, the skill reads ticket content to classify the UI task and derive test requirements from the Definition of Done.
- `--levels unit,component,e2e,visual` — explicit comma-separated list of levels to run. When omitted, levels are derived from the ticket DoD or the decision matrix.

If neither `--ticket` nor `--levels` is provided, prompt the user:

> Which test levels should I generate? Options: `unit`, `component`, `e2e`, `visual` (comma-separated), or provide a `--ticket` key so I can determine them automatically.

### Step 2 — Load Framework Specialization

Detect the project's UI framework and load the corresponding specialization reference:

1. **Detect framework** by checking (in order):
   - Config files in the project root: `next.config.*` (Next.js/React), `nuxt.config.*` (Nuxt/Vue), `angular.json` (Angular), `svelte.config.*` (Svelte/SvelteKit)
   - Framework-specific dependencies in `package.json`: `next`, `react`, `vue`, `@angular/core`, `svelte`
   - Existing test file imports (fallback heuristic)

2. **Load the specialization** from `references/<framework>-specialization.md`:
   - React / Next.js → [`references/react-specialization.md`](references/react-specialization.md)
   - Future specializations follow the same `<framework>-specialization.md` convention.

3. If no specialization file exists for the detected framework, proceed with **generic defaults only** (the core skill remains fully functional without a specialization — it just won't suggest framework-specific tool variants or starter configs).

Log the result:

```
Framework detected: React (Next.js)
Specialization loaded: references/react-specialization.md
```

### Step 3 — UI Task Detection

Classify the current task by running `classifyUITask()` logic against the available context:

1. If a ticket key was provided, read the ticket content (title, description, acceptance criteria, DoD).
2. Scan the current working branch diff (`git diff main...HEAD --name-only`) to identify changed/new UI files.
3. Classify into one of these task types:
   - **New atom/molecule component** — new file in `shared/ui/` or `entities/*/ui/`
   - **New organism/widget** — new file in `widgets/`
   - **New page/feature** — new file in `app/` pages or `features/`
   - **Redesign existing screen** — modifications to existing page/widget with visual changes
   - **Bug fix on existing UI** — fix-type commit touching UI files
   - **Design token/theme change** — changes to `globals.css`, theme files, or token definitions
   - **Accessibility improvement** — a11y-related changes (aria attributes, keyboard navigation, focus management)

Output the classification and proceed.

### Step 4 — Determine Test Levels

Resolve which of the four levels apply using this priority order:

1. **Explicit `--levels` argument** — use as-is, no further logic needed.
2. **Ticket DoD** — if the ticket specifies test requirements (e.g. "unit tests required", "E2E coverage for happy path"), map those to levels.
3. **Decision matrix** — look up the task type from Step 3 in [`references/test-level-matrix.md`](references/test-level-matrix.md) to determine Required / Recommended / Optional levels.

If the matrix yields only "Recommended" levels (none Required), confirm with the user before proceeding.

Present the resolved levels to the user:

```
UI Task Type: New organism/widget
Test levels:
  - Unit:      Required
  - Component: Required
  - E2E:       Recommended
  - Visual:    If Figma exists → checking...
```

### Step 5 — Detect Tools

For each active level, detect whether the necessary tooling is installed. Follow the detection order specified in [`references/tool-detection.md`](references/tool-detection.md). Use the loaded specialization (Step 2) for framework-specific tool variants and install commands.

#### Level 1 — Unit Testing

1. Check for `vitest.config.ts` or `vitest.config.js` in the project root.
2. If not found, check for `jest.config.*` (js, ts, json, cjs, mjs).
3. Check for the framework-appropriate Testing Library package in `package.json` (e.g. `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/vue`, `@testing-library/svelte`).
4. If nothing found, suggest installation using the specialization's recommended install command. Generic fallback:
   ```
   pnpm add -D vitest @testing-library/{framework} @testing-library/jest-dom
   ```

#### Level 2 — Component Testing

1. Check for the framework-appropriate Playwright CT package in `package.json` (e.g. `@playwright/experimental-ct-react`, `@playwright/experimental-ct-vue`).
2. Check for `playwright-ct.config.ts` in the project root.
3. If not found, suggest installation using the specialization's recommended install command and provide a starter config.

#### Level 3 — E2E Testing

1. Check for `@playwright/test` in `package.json`.
2. Check for `playwright.config.ts` in the project root.
3. If not found, suggest installation:
   ```
   pnpm add -D @playwright/test && pnpm exec playwright install
   ```

#### Level 4 — Visual Testing

1. Visual testing always uses Playwright + `pixelmatch`.
2. Check for `pixelmatch` and `pngjs` in `package.json`.
3. If not found, suggest installation:
   ```
   pnpm add -D pixelmatch pngjs
   ```

If any required tool is missing, ask the user whether to install it or skip that level.

### Step 6 — Generate Tests

For each active level, delegate to the appropriate mastery skill:

| Level     | Skill                                            | Notes                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Unit      | `mastering-vitest` or `jest-coverage-automation` | Based on detected tool from Step 4         |
| Component | (inline generation)                              | Generate Playwright CT test files directly |
| E2E       | `playwright-e2e-automation`                      | Pass route paths and user flows            |
| Visual    | `ui-visual-testing`                              | Pass Figma mapping and screenshot config   |

#### Unit test generation

Invoke the detected unit testing skill with the target files:

```
/mastering-vitest --files <changed-ui-files> --coverage-target 80
```

or

```
/jest-coverage-automation --files <changed-ui-files>
```

#### Component test generation

Generate Playwright Component Test files that:

- Mount the component in isolation with representative props
- Test interactive states (hover, focus, disabled, loading, error)
- Capture screenshots at each viewport breakpoint
- Verify accessibility (axe-core integration if available)

#### E2E test generation

Invoke Playwright E2E automation:

```
/playwright-e2e-automation --routes <affected-routes> --flows <user-flows>
```

#### Visual test generation

Invoke the visual testing skill:

```
/ui-visual-testing --ticket <KEY> --mode figma|screenshot|both
```

### Step 7 — Run Tests and Report

Execute all generated tests and produce a summary report:

1. **Run unit tests:**

   ```bash
   pnpm vitest run --reporter=verbose <test-files>
   ```

2. **Run component tests:**

   ```bash
   pnpm playwright test --config=playwright-ct.config.ts <test-files>
   ```

3. **Run E2E tests:**

   ```bash
   pnpm playwright test <test-files>
   ```

4. **Run visual tests:**
   Handled by the `ui-visual-testing` skill's own execution pipeline.

5. **Aggregate results:**

```
=== UI Testing Report ===
Task:       New organism/widget — KpiDashboard
Ticket:     DOP-194

Level 1 — Unit:       8/8 passed  (coverage: 87%)
Level 2 — Component:  4/4 passed  (3 viewports)
Level 3 — E2E:        3/3 passed  (happy path, error state, empty state)
Level 4 — Visual:     2/2 passed  (diff < 2% threshold)

Overall: PASS
```

If any level fails, provide actionable diagnostics:

- For unit failures: show the failing assertion and the component code in question.
- For component failures: include the screenshot diff if available.
- For E2E failures: include the trace file path and the step that failed.
- For visual failures: include the diff image path and the mismatch percentage.

## Error Handling

- If a mastery skill is not available, fall back to inline test generation using best practices for the detected tool.
- If the dev server is not running (needed for E2E/visual), attempt to start it and wait for readiness before proceeding.
- If test generation fails for a specific level, log the error and continue with remaining levels.
- Always produce a partial report even if some levels fail.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning                                                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | All requested levels passed                             |
| 1    | One or more test failures                               |
| 2    | Tool detection failed and user declined setup           |
| 3    | Configuration error (invalid arguments, missing ticket) |
